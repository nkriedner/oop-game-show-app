# Word Guessing Game (using Object Oriented Programming)

This project is the fourth task for Teamtreehouse's "Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree".

It's a browser-based, word guessing game. I was asked to use JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

The html and css files (as well as the empty js files) were given by Teamtreehouse.
I wrote the code in the js files.
