# Word Guessing Game (using Object Oriented Programming)

This project is the fourth task for Teamtreehouse's "Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree".

It's a browser-based, word guessing game. I was asked to use JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

I wrote all of the JavaScript code in the js files.

The html and css files were provided by Teamtreehouse.
For some personalization I made the following CSS changes:

-   Change background color of body to a gradient
-   Changed background color for correct and wrong letters of the onscreen keyboard (to red/green)
-   Changed font-family and size of h2s
-   Changed background color of the letters in the phrase display when they are shown (to darkgrey)
-   Create a transition for the letters when they display
-   Changed background of scoreboard
